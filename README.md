# The Ground is Lava

<h2> Description </h2>
<p>
	The Ground is Lava is a small 2D platformer demo created in Unity. It was meant as a way to introduce and familarize myself with Unity, and also managed to give me experience with pixel art, level design, animation, and many more aspects of the game development experience. While it is quite simple (and unfortunately does not have any audio as of yet), it was a blast to work on in between school and work. That being said, it was created in the summer of 2016, so while I've tried to clean it up a bit, it is not the best representation of my coding ability. Additionally,this was my way of teaching myself Unity, so I referenced a lot of documentation samples and many public tutorials and as a result cannot claim complete responsibility for every line of code.
